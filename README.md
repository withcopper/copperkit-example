# CopperKit Example

[The CopperKit framework](https://github.com/withcopper/CopperKit) allows your iOS app to register or authenticate a person with only a few lines of code. You configure CopperKit to ask the person to share specific information with your app, and with their approval we return that to your runtime. It saves you the development work required to build sign up, sign in, password recovery infrastructure and within your app.

Copper remembers a personâ€™s information so that signups within your app can be a single tap, rather than the person reentering their information.  Plus users love how Copper uses their phone number for authentication so they never see a password. You can expect more people will sign up for your app rather than abandon it at this critical step with Copper.

This sample project demonstrates how to use CopperKit in a working app.
